#+DESCRIPTION: Elisp interface to query and show documenation using dash!
#+KEYWORDS: emacs, dash, dash docs, documentation

* Dash-Docs

  This package provides an =Elisp= interface to query
  and show documentation using [[http://www.kapeli.com/dash][Dash]] docsets.

  It doesn't require =Dash= app, we rely on any
  =html= file browser, however =eww= is recommended!

* Requirements

  - SQLite3

* Dependencies

  - xml
  - url
  - url-http
  - mm-decode
  - json
  - cl-macs

* Installation
** Manually

   Clone =dash-docs= repository to an arbitrary location:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   $ git clone https://github.com/esac-io/dash-docs ~/.emacs.d/site-elisp/dash-docs

   #+END_SRC

   Add =Dash-docs= directory to =load-path= in your
   Emacs initialization file (~init.el~) and load it.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   ;; add to load-path
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/replace/me/to/dash-docs/full/path")

   ;; load dash-docs feature
   (require 'dash-docs nil t)

   #+END_SRC

   - Note: For a more dynamic approach:
     - =M-x load-file RET=
     - =M-x load-library RET dash-docs RET=

** Compile

   * Note: Optional (recommended).

   To compile the files to the =Elisp= byte-compiled representation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   [at-dash-docs-root-directory]$ make

   #+END_SRC

** Docsets

   Dash-docs uses the same docsets as [[http://www.kapeli.com/dash][Dash]].

   You can install them with =M-x dash-docs-install-docset= for the
   official docsets or =M-x dash-docs-install-user-docset= for user
   contributed docsets (experimental).

   To install a docset from a file in your drive you can use
   =M-x dash-docs-install-docset-from-file=.

   That function takes as input a ~tgz~ file that you obtained,
   starting from a folder named =<docset-name>.docset=, with the command:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh

   tar --exclude='.DS_Store' -cvzf <docset-name>.tgz <docset-name>.docset

   #+END_SRC

   as explained [[https://kapeli.com/docsets#dashdocsetfeed][here]].

* Customize

  - =dash-docs-docsets-path= :: is the prefix for your docsets,
    defaults to =~/.docsets=.

  - =dash-docs-min-length= :: tells dash-docs from which length to start
    searching, defaults to =3=.

  - =dash-docs-browser-func= :: is a function to encapsulate the way to browse
    Dash' docsets, defaults to =browse-url=. For example, if you want to use eww to
    browse your docsets, you can do: =(setq dash-docs-browser-func 'eww)=.

  When =dash-docs-enable-debugging= is non-nil stderr from sqlite queries is
  captured and displayed in a buffer. The default value is =t=. Setting this
  to =nil= may speed up queries on some machines (capturing stderr requires
  the creation and deletion of a temporary file for each query).

* Variables
** Common

   - =dash-docs-common-docsets= :: is a list that should contain the
     docsets to be active always. In all buffers.

** Local

   Different subsets of docsets can be activated depending on the
   buffer. For the moment (it may change in the future) we decided it's a
   plain local variable you should setup for every different
   filetype.

   This way you can also do fancier things like project-wise
   docsets sets.

   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

   (defun go-set-docset ()
     (interactive)
     (setq-local dash-docs-docsets '("Go")))

   ;; add hook
   (add-hook 'go-mode-hook 'go-set-docset)

   #+END_SRC

* FAQ

  - Does it works in MacOS/Windows?
    Duno, and I don't care.

  - Does it works in Linux/BSDs?
    YES!

  - I get nil for every search I do!
    Make sure you don't have SQLite3 .mode column but .mode list
    (the default). Check your ~.sqliterc~.

  - When selecting an item in dash-docs, no browser
    lookup occurs with =Firefox= and =Emacs= >= 24.4: \\

    Try: \\

    #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; customize function to display the current
    ;; buffer in a ww browser
    (customize-set-variable 'browse-url-browser-function 'browse-url-generic)

    ;; customize the name of the browser program used
    ;; by `browse-url-generic'
    (customize-set-variable 'browse-url-generic-program "/path/to/firefox")

    ;; customize default function to browse Dashâ€™s docsets
    (customize-set-variable 'dash-docs-browser-func 'browse-url-generic)
    #+END_SRC

  #+BEGIN_SRC
  Documentation is like sex: when it is good, it is very, very good;
  and when it is bad, it is better than nothing.
